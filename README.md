Emelem
======

Emelem is a machine learning (ML) model platform. The goal is to manage ML models in a smart and secure way. 

This project would not have been possible without great projects such as:

- [superset](http://airbnb.io/projects/superset/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [flask-appbuilder](https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

and, obviously, their dependencies.
